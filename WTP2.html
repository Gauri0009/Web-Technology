   <p><b>Oshho Garden: </b>In 1989, the Osho Ashram assumed ownership of the Osho Garden area. It partnered with the Shunyo Foundation, a Japanese environmental group, to transform it into the park that it is today.

Osho Garden has seen various alterations and upgrades through the years. Initially, the garden had few flowering plants and trees. The garden, however, saw a makeover in the 1990s when a team of horticulturists and landscape architects rebuilt the site. The new design included numerous plants, trees and flowers from across the world.</p></li>
